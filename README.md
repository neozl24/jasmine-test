# JASMINE Test

## How to use

Open `index.html` in your browser and the jasmine tests will run automatically. The results may be given in seconds(depending on the network) because some tests rely on asynchronous functions. Then at the bottom of the page, you'll see how many of tests have passed while how many else have failed.
